        <h1 class="titulo um">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
        <p class="paragrafo primeiro"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a<br>
            type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the<br>
            leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was<br>
            popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br>
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software<br>
            like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        </p>

        <h1 class="titulo dois">Why do we use it?</h1>
        <p class="paragrafo segundo">
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <br>
             content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum <br>
             is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br>
             using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many <br>
             desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br>
             default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites <br>
             still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes <br>
             by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
