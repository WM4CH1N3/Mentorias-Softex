        <h1 class="titulo um" id="principal">Where does it come from?</h1>
       
        <p class="importante"> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br>
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,<br>
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin<br>
            professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one<br>
            of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum<br>
            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical<br>
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus<br>
            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, <br>
            written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, <br>
            very popular during the Renaissance.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="importante">
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes<br>
            from a line in section 1.10.32.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced<br>
            below for those interested.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="importante">
            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"<br>
            by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied<br>
            by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.<br>
